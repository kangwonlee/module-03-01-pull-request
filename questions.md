# Any remaining questions about pull requests

## How to associate a pull request with an issue?

I may want to propose some possible improvements to an existing repository. If I start a new pull request, it becomes to have a different serial number. How can I make sure if is related to the issue?

## How can I make a more acceptable pull request?

I proposed a couple of pull requests but IMHO the acceptance rate is not so high.  How can I make my pull requests more acceptable?  Especially when the maintainer or other contributers seem too busy.

## How can I motivate myself to propose more pull requests?

World is not perfect and I believe codes can help, at least a little bit.  However, I find myself carried away from writing more such code lines.  How can I find more motivations and time?

## How can I designate a person as the reviewer?

I tried to add a person as a reviewer but Github does not let me. How can I? Is it because the person is not a member of the project?

## Can a PR have more than reviewers ?

Possible?
If so, how to make final decisions? And? Or?
